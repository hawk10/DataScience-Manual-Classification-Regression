# K-Nearest-Neighbour-kNN-
Implementing the kNN methodology

Normally projects such as these are implemented in Python or R. I wanted to test out how difficult it would be to do this in Java 
(in the same time, increase my proficieny in Java). This is an implementation of the kNN, currently the approach is using the Eucladian Distance 
to train the similarity model; I plan to add in the other approaches later on.
Current project version is very much harcoded. For the later versions I might implement REST to make the dataset to upload, as well as which
algo to use to determine the similarity more dynamic
