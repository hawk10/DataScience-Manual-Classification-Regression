# DataScience-Manual-Classification-Regression-
Main Focus of this project is to manually write and implement the algorithms used in Classification and regression such as the Euclidean Distance, Linear Regression etc. This means no external library nor apis will be used to train the models. If the Linear Regression algo is used to predict a value, the linear regression algorithm will be coded manually.
So far:-
1) Euclidean Distance - implemented


Predicting/Recommending the Category of Object Utilizing the kNN methodology on the basis of similarity. 

Normally projects such as these are implemented in Python or R. I wanted to test out how difficult it would be to do this in Java 
(in the same time, increase my proficieny in Java). This is an implementation of the kNN, currently the approach is using the Eucladian Distance metric.

To train the model faster, spring jobs are used. For now, ut is excuted automatically when the application is run.

To Do:
1) Add in other Distance Metrics
2) Implement REST to make dataset upload, which distance metrics to use more dynamic
3) Disable auto run of job and manually execute it
